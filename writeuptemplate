STEPS for building the pipeline:
### 1. Describe your pipeline. As part of the description, explain how you modified the draw_lines() function.

first i have to install anaconda and other necessary libraries where i had several problems installing them.
All the images are the same size. If not we would have need to define region of interest in relative rather than absolute coordinates. In a real car we would have control over the images but for testing that is not necessarily A case.
Now let's build the pipeline - for now the parameters we apply to a video stream are fixed. So I am going to encode them as default values in the pipeline function. This first pipeline just generates the Hough lines. It took about 5 minutes to find good settings here.
Would be good to display images in a more interactive mode - so reading off coordinates is easier. Maybe try and explore what is possible with Bokeh.

### 2. Identify potential shortcomings with your current pipeline
Never expected that python would accept greek leeters that is something awesome
my pipeline is working good for images when it comes to videos it was not that efficient
### 3. Suggest possible improvements to your pipeline
I noticed that when there is no line in the immediate foreground (for example in the white video at 3s) the left hand line is pulled away from the lane.
